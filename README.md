Alex Blaisure and Jamar Cook HW1 Submission
We used unreal Engine 5.4.4 and nothing else special to run it.

We used youtube videos from Brendan Kelley for the most part and then more youtube videos for the health components and traps.

We ended up using google and reddit sites for just general questions about how to out on textures and apply settings.
We used free and paid assets on Unreal Engine marketplace.

We found issues with getting our work to show up on both sides through github. We tried multiple different avenues to achieive fixing this. We did not end up making it work and so we went with a segmented approach.

We worked very well together as both of us had around the same amount of knowledge of programming and computers as a whole. We both had a good schedule of meetings where we both showed up and the work was split up very equally we feel. 
Jamar took on the actual level design and overall feel. As where I went for doing most of the blueprints to make sure all the components were there. 

We spent hours of our first few and last meeting trying to fix our issues from not sharing with eachother. We first came up with a plan in a two hour meeting toward the start of October. We wanted to make an ambitious project for our first one where it was going to be a 
military stealth game and 1 level at night. With all of the issues we couldn't make this happen and made it more practical. The meetings that we had were mostly check-ins and more plans which worked out well. We worked well together and got along well. We often communicated on Discord messages and voice channels.
Meetings: October 9, 2024; October 16, 2024; Oct 18, Oct 22, Oct 24, Oct 29, Oct 31.
